I'm a ZJU100 Young Professor at the College of Integrated Circuits, Zhejiang University. Before joining ZJU, I worked with Prof. Zhiru Zhang as a Post-Doctoral Associate at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University. Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree from the Dept. of CSE, CUHK, under the supervision of Prof. Bei Yu in Jul. 2022. My research interests include ML in EDA, design space exploration, Deep Neural Network hardware acceleration, RISC-V SoC, and LLM for DTCO. My work has been recognized with two ICCAD Best Paper Awards, Bronze Medal of the ICCAD Student Research Competition, and a Best Paper Award Nomination of DATE.

I have openings for highly motivated prospective M.Phil./Ph.D. students and Research Assistants with backgrounds in computer science and engineering, electronic engineering, applied mathematics, or other related fields. Please contact me with your CV and transcript if youâ€™re interested.
