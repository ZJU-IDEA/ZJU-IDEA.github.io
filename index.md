# IDEA Lab @ Zhejiang University

The primary research areas include integrated circuit design and design automation (EDA), covering design-manufacturing collaboration, low-power circuits and systems, deep learning algorithms and hardware acceleration, as well as power and signal integrity.

- **Design-Manufacturing Collaboration**: Cross-level modeling and optimization across process, device, and circuit layers.
- **Low-Power Circuits and Systems**: Approximate computing and storage-compute integrated circuits/architectures/systems.
- **Deep Learning Algorithms and Hardware Acceleration**: Optimization of deep learning operators, multi-modal large models, and algorithm/system reliability.
- **Power and Signal Integrity**: Machine learning-assisted solvers, parallel algorithms, and system-level simulation/optimization/management techniques.
